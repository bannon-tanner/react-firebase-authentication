This project is demonstrating authentication from [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) using Firebase

Use `!!variable` to return `true` or `false` on non-boolean variables

Navigation Guards
- dynamically change route configuration whether logged in or not
